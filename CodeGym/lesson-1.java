// Java commands must be inside functions, and functions must be inside classes
//in Java, functions are also called methods 
//Method - is part of a class. A class is divided into methods and methods contain commands
// Java programs are made up of classes - classes contain methods - methods contain commands 

//classes can contain multiple methods too
