//A method body consists of commands
//println() does not display text on a new line. INstead, it displays text on current line - the next
//line will be displayed at the beginning of a new line!

//Variables are things for storing data. Think of a variable as a box.
//Variable has 3 properties -- name, type, value
// name: variable
//type: values/data...int, fractional number, string, etc
//value: some object or data stored in variable

int a;
String s;
double c;

int a = 5;
int b = 6;

//YOU CANNOT create two variables with same name, but in different methods you can :)
//compact code vs long code!
int d = c + 1; 

int d;
d = c + 1;

String s = "I'm Jess";
String s;
s = "I'm Jess";

int x = 333;
String s = "Amigo" + x;
//Amigo333
