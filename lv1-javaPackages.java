//OVERVIEW
//Packages are for group related classes, interfaces and sub packages 
//BENEFITS
// - Making related types easier to find - packages contain types that are logically related 
// - avoid naming conflicts - a package will help us to uniquely identify a class
// - controlling access -- we can control visibility and access to types by combining packages and access 
//modifiers
